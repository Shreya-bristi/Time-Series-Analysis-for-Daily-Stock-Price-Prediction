# Time-Series-Analysis-for-Daily-Stock-Price-Prediction
The aim of our work is to apply relevant concepts of Time Series Analysis for daily closing stock price prediction of Indus Tower Limited. At first we tried to predict the mean behavior of the data set using appropriate AR, MA and ARIMA models. Thereafter, we have used Hybrid ARIMA-ARCH and Hybrid ARIMA-GARCH to capture the volatility of the series.
